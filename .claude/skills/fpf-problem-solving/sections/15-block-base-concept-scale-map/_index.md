_(Choose 3–5 that fit the thread; do not place Contexts here.)_

### F.17:13 - Didactic Aids

* **Trip‑wire column (optional).** A ⚡ marker in `Notes` for known homonyms (e.g., *process (BPMN) ≠ process (thermo)*).
* **DesignRunTag tag (optional).** `design` / `run` hint for concepts whose senses split by time.

### F.17:14 - Micro Examples (one line each, illustrative)

*(These illustrate Layout A headings; swap Contexts to match your cut.)*

**Row: `U.Work` (Execution)**
`Tech=Execution - Plain=run` — “Dated, resource‑consuming occurrence realising a MethodDescription.”
**BPMN 2.0 (2011)**: *Activity instance* - **PROV‑O (2013)**: `prov:Activity` - **ITIL 4**: *change/incident record (run)* - **SOSA/SSN**: *(context: producer of Observation)* - **Essence (Language)**: *Activity occurrence* - **Bridges**: CL=3 (BPMN≍PROV) - **Rationale**: *All cells denote the concrete happening, not the recipe nor the capability.*

**Row: `U.MethodDescription` (Recipe)**
`Tech=MethodDescription - Plain=recipe` — “Recorded specification guiding executions.”
**BPMN 2.0 (2011)**: *Process model* - **PROV‑O (2013)**: `prov:Plan` - **ITIL 4**: *SOP / Work instruction* - **Essence (Language)**: *Activity space/Practice description* - **Bridges**: CL=2 (loss: control‑flow vs intent) - **Rationale**: *All cells denote the codified ‘how’, distinct from both the performer and the run.*

> These rows are examples only; your UTS MUST be compiled from your chosen **Contexts** (Layout A) or **Discipline Columns (DC)** (Layout B) and SenseCells.

### F.17:15 - Relations

* **Builds on:** F.1–F.3 (contexts & local senses), F.7 (Concept‑Set), F.5 (names), F.9 (Bridges).
* **Feed:** Part A and Part C definitions/examples (row ids used as cross‑refs); teaching bundles (F.16).
* **Constrained by.** A.7 **Strict Distinction**, A.11 **Parsimony**, **E.10 §6 Twin‑Register Discipline** (Tech/Plain), **E.10.P (prefix registry: tv: / ut:)**, E.10.D1 **Context discipline**.

### F.17:16 - Migration Notes

* **Re‑blocking.** If the Block Plan changes, keep row ids stable; move rows between blocks rather than renumbering.
* **Context growth.** When adding a new Context, populate SenseCells progressively; do not claim coverage until ≥ 1 row per block cites it.
* **Name evolution.** Update **Plain** labels freely for pedagogy; change **Tech** labels only via F.5 with clear S‑rules.


### F.17:17 - FAQ (authoring hygiene)

**Q1. Is the UTS a registry?**
*A.* No. It is a **didactic publication artifact**. No CRUD semantics, no workflows.

**Q2. Can we collapse two Contexts if their terms look identical?**
*A.* Only via **F.9 Bridge** with **CL=3**. Identity must be argued, not assumed by spelling.

**Q3. Where do state‑graphs (A.2.5) show up?**
*A.* In `Notes` or as a dedicated row if the stateful nature of a Role family is central to the thread.

**Q4. How do we show deontic approvals?**
*A.* The concept rows (`U.SpeechAct`, `U.Commitment`, `U.PromiseContentClause`, `U.PromiseFulfillmentEvaluation`) make the communicative/epistemic pieces visible; enactment appears in examples, not as sheet mechanics.

### F.17:18 - 90‑Second Teaching Script

> “To make our language usable, we publish a **Unified Term Sheet** for each thread. Each **row** is one **unified concept** (a Concept‑Set) named with a **Tech** and a **Plain** label and tied to concrete senses in our chosen **context of meaning**. If two contexts differ, we show an explicit **Bridge** with a **CL score** and a short **loss note**. The rows are grouped into 5–7 **didactic blocks** so the whole sheet fits in working memory. This is not a database; it’s the **one table** a careful mind can hold. From this sheet, everyone—engineers, managers, researchers—can talk precisely about **the same things** across disciplines.”
